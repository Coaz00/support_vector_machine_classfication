The goal of this project is two class classification using support vector machine classifier. Dataset is included. Data is split into training and test sets and standardized. K-fold crossvalidation was used in order to determine optimal hinge-loss penalty parameter C. Using linear classifier 87.5% accuracy was achieved on training and 95% on test set. Using polynomial kernel non-linear classifier made and 96.5% accuracy was achieved on training and 95% on test set.
